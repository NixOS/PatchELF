PatchELF is a simple utility for modifing existing ELF executables and
libraries.  In particular, it can do the following:

* Change the dynamic loader ("ELF interpreter") of executables:

  $ patchelf --set-interpreter /lib/my-ld-linux.so.2 my-program

* Change the RPATH of executables and libraries:

  $ patchelf --set-rpath /opt/my-libs/lib:/other-libs my-program

* Shrink the RPATH of executables and libraries:

  $ patchelf --shrink-rpath my-program

  This removes from the RPATH all directories that do not contain a
  library referenced by DT_NEEDED fields of the executable or library.
  For instance, if an executable references one library libfoo.so, has
  an RPATH "/lib:/usr/lib:/foo/lib", and libfoo.so can only be found
  in /foo/lib, then the new RPATH will be "/foo/lib".

* Remove declared dependencies on dynamic libraries (DT_NEEDED
  entries):

  $ patchelf --remove-needed libfoo.so.1 my-program

  This option can be given multiple times.

BUGS

The `strip' command from binutils generated broken executables when
applied to the output of patchelf (if `--set-rpath' or
`--set-interpreter' with a larger path than the original is used).
This appears to be a bug in binutils
(http://bugs.strategoxt.org/browse/NIXPKGS-85).


RELEASE HISTORY

0.8 (January 15, 2014):

* Fix a segfault caused by certain illegal entries in symbol tables.

0.7 (January 7, 2014):

* Rewrite section indices in symbol tables. This for instance allows
  gdb to show proper backtraces.

* Added `--remove-needed' option.

0.6 (November 7, 2011):

* Hacky support for executables created by the Gold linker.

* Support segments with an alignment of 0 (contributed by Zack
  Weinberg).

* Added a manual page (contributed by Jeremy Sanders
