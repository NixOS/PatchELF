.SH NAME
patchelf - Modify ELF files

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B patchelf \fIOPTION FILE

.SH DESCRIPTION

PatchELF is a simple utility for modifying existing ELF executables
and libraries.  It can change the dynamic loader ("ELF interpreter")
of executables and change the RPATH of executables and libraries.

.SH OPTIONS

The single option given operates on a given FILE, editing in place.

.IP "\fB--interpreter \fIINTERPRETER\fR or \fB--set-interpreter \fIINTERPRETER"
Change the dynamic loader ("ELF interpreter") of executable given to
INTERPRETER.

.IP "\fB--print-interpreter"
Prints the ELF interpreter of the executable.

.IP "\fB--set-rpath \fIRPATH"
Change the RPATH of the executable or library to RPATH.

.IP "\fB--shrink-rpath"
Remove from the RPATH all directories that do not contain a
library referenced by DT_NEEDED fields of the executable or library.

For instance, if an executable references one library libfoo.so, has
an RPATH "/lib:/usr/lib:/foo/lib", and libfoo.so can only be found
in /foo/lib, then the new RPATH will be "/foo/lib".

.IP "\fB--print-rpath"
Prints the RPATH for an executable or library.

.IP "\fB--force-rpath"
Forces the use of the obsolete DT_RPATH in the file instead of
DT_RUNPATH. By default DT_RPATH is converted to DT_RUNPATH.

.IP "\fB--remove-needed \fILIBRARY"
Remove a declared dependency on dynamic libraries. This option can
be given multiple times.

.IP "\fB--add-needed \fILIBRARY"
Add a declared dependency on dynamic libraries. This option can
be given multiple times.

.IP "\fB--replace-needed \fILIBRARY NEW_LIBRARY"
Replace a declared dependency on dynamic libraries. This option can
be given multiple times.

.IP "\fB--debug"
Prints details of the changes made to the input file.

.IP "\fB\-h \fRor\fB \--help"
Prints help information.

.IP "\fB\-v \fRor\fB \--version"
Shows the version of patchelf.
